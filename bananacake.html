    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It is a beloved Southern dessert with an army of devoted fans myself included and for good reason!</p>
    <p>A few shortcut ingredients make this cake incredibly easy to pull off. The first is vanilla cake mix. This cuts down the ingredient list significantly, and means you can tackle this dessert in less than an hour.</p>
    <p>The second is banana cream pudding mix. It gets added straight to the cake batter and is a trick home bakers have sworn by for years to keep their cakes super moist. It also gives this cake its signature banana cream pudding flavor and cheery yellow color. If unavailable, you can use vanilla pudding mix in a pinch, although the flavor will be a bit less banana-y.</p>
    <p>Lastly, cream cheese gets added to the whipped cream frosting to help stabilize it. This prevents the frosting from deflating or melting and gives it a fluffy texture. Taste-wise, you might not know itâ€™s there, but it helps the cake last for multiple days in the fridge. Equally as delicious is this banana pudding cheesecake recipe.</p>
